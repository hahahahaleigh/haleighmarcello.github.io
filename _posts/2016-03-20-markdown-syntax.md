On August 15th, I presented my research, tentatively titled “LGBT O.C.” at the Summer Research Symposium at the University of California, Irvine. My presentation showcased the work that I’ve been doing as a part of the Competitive Edge Program at UCI.

In my presentation, I briefly went over what I’ve discovered about LGBT activism in Orange County, California during the 1980s. I provided some historical context on what the 1980s were like politically, and illustrated the impact the AIDS crisis had on the LGBT community during the time. Following this, I provided some examples of LGBT organizations that were active in Orange County in the ‘80s. At the end of my presentation, I explained one instance of conservative backlash to Orange County’s LGBT activism: protesting and violence at Orange County’s first ever pride festival in 1989.

The symposium went well, and I was glad to showcase my research. I still have a lot more work to do in order to tell this forgotten history.
